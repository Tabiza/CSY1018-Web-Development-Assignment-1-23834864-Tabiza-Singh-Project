                    <h3>Hamro Article</h3>
                    <p align="justify">I recently completed a project designing an online article website i.e: hamro atricle. I created the website from scratch, starting with the design of the home page and working my way down the page. I coded the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the website, as well as added search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to help the website become more visible online. I also coordinated with a web hosting provider to ensure that the website was secure and functioning properly. After the website was built, I developed an analytics dashboard to monitor website traffic and user engagement. I also created a content management system (CMS) to allow content authors to easily add and manage articles on the website. Overall, I was able to design a fully functioning online article website that met the client's needs.</p>

                    <p align="justify">
                        I recently had the opportunity to design an e-learning website for a client. My task was to create a platform that would enable students to access learning materials and engage with the subject matter in an interactive way.                     
                        I started by creating the structure and layout of the website, taking into consideration the client’s needs and preferences. I then began designing the user interface, focusing on making it easy to navigate and visually appealing. I used HTML and CSS to code the website, while also implementing JavaScript to create interactive elements.                 
                        Through this project, I gained valuable experience in web design and development, as well as user experience design. I learned how to create an engaging and enjoyable learning experience for students. This knowledge and experience will be beneficial to me in the future as I continue to design and develop websites.</p>

                <h3>Open Idea</h3>
                <p align="justify">I recently had the opportunity to design an open idea website for a small business. The goal of the website was to provide customers with a platform to share their ideas and thoughts on the company’s products and services. I began the project by researching the company’s current website and understanding their goals and objectives. I then designed a user-friendly interface and incorporated features like a commenting system and an idea submission form. I also developed a content management system so that the company could easily update the website with new and relevant content. Throughout the project, I kept in close contact with the client to ensure their needs were met and the website was up to their standards. I’m proud of the website I designed and the feedback I’ve received from the company has been positive.</p>

                    <h3>Trip Palnner</h3>
                    <p align="justify">I recently had the opportunity to design a trip planner website for a client. I was responsible for creating the user interface, developing the functionality, and ensuring the website was easy to use. I began by researching existing designs and gathering user feedback. I then used this information to develop a wireframe and visual design. I also developed the back-end functionality, including the ability to search for destinations, book flights and hotels, and store user information. Finally, I tested and refined the design to ensure it was working correctly and was intuitive for users. It was a great experience and I learned a lot about web design and user experience.</p>

                        I recently had the opportunity to design a website for a bakery. My experience included working with the bakery owners to come up with a design that showcased their unique products and services. I used Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create a visually appealing website with a modern design. I also worked with the bakery owners to create content for the website and ensure that it was optimized for search engines. Finally, I tested the website for usability and made sure that all links were working correctly. This was a great experience that allowed me to showcase my design skills and work with a real-world client.</p>
