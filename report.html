                    <h3>My Experience while designing this site.</h3>
                    <p>I recently had the opportunity to design a basic portfolio website for a client using HTML and
                        CSS. Before I started the project, I created a detailed plan of how I wanted the website to look
                        and what content I wanted to include.<br><br>

                        I started by creating the HTML structure of the site by coding the basic elements such as
                        headings and paragraphs. I also included a navigation bar, which would allow the user to quickly
                        access the different sections of the website. After I completed this, I moved on to styling the
                        website using CSS. <br><br>

                        I began by styling the headings, paragraphs, and links. I wanted the website to have a
                        professional look, so I used a bold font and dark colors to contrast the text against the white
                        background. I then added a background image to the website and used padding and margins to
                        create a more attractive layout.<br><br>

                        Next, I worked on creating the portfolio section of the website. I used a grid-based layout to
                        display the images, and I added a hover effect so that when the user moves their cursor over the
                        image, the image would become larger. I also added a caption for each image so the user would
                        know what the image was about. <br><br>

                        Finally, I added a contact section to the website so that the user could easily get in touch
                        with the client. I included a contact form, as well as a map that showed the client’s
                        location.<br><br>

                        Once I was finished coding the website, I tested it to make sure that everything was working
                        properly. After I was sure that it was bug-free, I submitted the website to the client for
                        review. The client was pleased with the result and was happy to have a portfolio website that
                        looked professional.<br><br>

                        Designing a portfolio website with HTML and CSS was a great learning experience. I was able to
                        hone my skills in coding, as well as gain a better understanding of web design. I was also able
                        to create a website that was easy to navigate and look professional. Overall, it was a great
                        experience and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about web design.
